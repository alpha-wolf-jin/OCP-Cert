Being logged into our Red Hat Internal SSO will grant you access. 2) User course progress has been migrated. You should see the same course progress as you did previously, now associated with your Kerberos ID. If you previously used more than 1 ID, results will vary, but the approach is documented above. NOTE: Remaining users who were not migrated, will be corrected Monday Jan 18 at 4:30 pm EST. Please be patient as the remaining user documents will take time to migrate. 3) As noted, Lab progress was not migrated. You will need to restart your labs. 4) Enrollment now happens automatically. If you are logging in for the first time with this Kerberos ID, you will see 365 days remaining. If you run out of days, logging in again will reset your days.
