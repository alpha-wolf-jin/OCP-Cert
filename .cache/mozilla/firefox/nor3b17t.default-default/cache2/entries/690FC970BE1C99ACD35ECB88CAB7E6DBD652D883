1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,590
We're going to get into
today a little bit about why

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,310
GPUs are important and the use
cases that they're used for.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,005
We'll overview the architecture that's
used to configure GPUs on OpenShift.

4
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,630
And we'll walk through
the installation of that,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,760
as well as showcase a couple really
simple demos of using GPUs on OpenShift.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,390
So quite simply the y for GPUs is that
they enable new types of workloads.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,380
Those workloads can be run
at the Cloud or at the edge.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,470
The hardware is great for

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,655
these parallel processing computing tasks

10
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:43,775
that are used in computer
graphics and image processing.

11
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:48,845
High-performance computing and
artificial intelligence type activities,

12
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:52,085
but not only that, GPUs are necessary,

13
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,240
otherwise, there's a ton of
problems that couldn't be solved in

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,605
an economically feasible way
without that type of hardware.

15
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:05,690
So many experts, including
the CEO of NVIDIA,

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,645
have gone as far to say that Moore's law,

17
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:13,145
the famous law about CPU
performance increases, is dead.

18
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:20,270
And that GPUs are what is going to
pick up where Moore's Law trails off.

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:27,380
The industry has already seen awesome
success cases where using GPUs,

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,485
they've been able to take
the time it takes to train

21
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:36,140
deep learning models from hundreds of
days down to less than single day.

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,730
So it might help to think about GPUs in

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,870
comparison to Cp is there are
various types of processors.

24
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,410
The hardware chips that execute
operations on computers.

25
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,330
The CPU is a general-purpose
processing unit.

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,300
So it's general enough to allow computers
to perform any programmed task.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,050
As you look at this picture, as
you move from left to right,

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,810
Will we see that we're getting more
specialized in the processing unit.

29
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,150
So in the middle, since the GPU,

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,650
which is great for general
purpose parallel computing tasks,

31
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,880
like I mentioned earlier,

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,980
computer graphics and image processing.

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,745
Even Bitcoin mining is heavily
dependent on using GPUs.

34
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:28,235
So these types of things that
are being leveraged by GPUs

35
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:31,220
are getting huge performance gains

36
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,780
and enabling new use cases that
CPU's just can't do efficiently.

37
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,740
What we see architecturally is
that GPUs sit at the bottom of

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,280
the stack and OpenShift sits on top
of and uses the GPUs at the hardware,

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,560
their apps and services that
need to leverage those GPUs.

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,980
They run inside of OpenShift,
inside of containers.

41
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:06,830
And all this goodness of machine
learning and being able to do advanced,

42
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,830
innovative types of workloads that are

43
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,400
like autonomous cars and video processing.

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,069
And some of the newer cybersecurity
techniques, massive logs analysis,

45
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,245
speech recognition speed, census,

46
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:25,325
speech synthesis, data
science, image processing.

47
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:28,790
There's a whole ton of cases for

48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,620
running containers that need
GPUs on behind the scenes.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,030
It's pretty straightforward how it works.

50
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,860
And OpenShift, we, by using operators,

51
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,530
OpenShift has the
capability to discover and

52
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,979
to automate the
configuration of those GPUs.

53
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,320
Otherwise, without operators, it would be

54
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,855
really complicated to do
that inside of kubernetes,

55
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,315
you'd have to install
drivers on each node setup,

56
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,505
device plugins and, and more.

57
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,900
So for us, there's two key
operators that play in this.

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,350
The first is the GPU operator and
the second is the NFT operator,

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,810
which we'll see more of in the demo.

60
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,815
I've got an OpenShift cluster
already provisioned in the Cloud.

61
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:17,720
And what we wanna do
first is go ahead and add

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,835
a virtual machine that has a GPU on it.

63
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,110
So in order to do that,

64
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,600
I'll scroll down into the compute section,

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,000
look at my machine sets so
I can see here I've got

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,600
two machines running already.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,030
I'll click, click Create, machine set,

68
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,040
and I'm pasting and actually

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,380
the YAML from one of those
existing machines sets.

70
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,975
And I'm going to change the
things I want to change about it.

71
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,205
So in this case,

72
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,035
I'm going to use a
different instance type.

73
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm going to use a G for dn,

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,685
which isn't AWS EC2 instance type,

75
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,680
that gives me one GPU.

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
And I'm going to change the name

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,210
and a couple other
properties and click Create.

78
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,849
That's going to tell OpenShift
to go ahead and provision

79
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,790
me a worker node that has that GPU.

80
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,590
And once that finishes,

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,005
we'll come back and we'll configure it.

82
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:10,025
So pretty quickly OpenShift going
to configure this machine set.

83
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,470
I can see I'm now running one of

84
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,860
one machines of the
instance type we asked for.

85
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,930
If I click the node section,

86
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,660
I can go and verify that
the node has stood up.

87
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,535
With the proper instance types,

88
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,650
another place we can see that details.

89
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,935
So let's configure this so that we
can install the operators we need.

90
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,440
So go to the operator
hub and we'll search for

91
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,385
the NFT operator node
feature discovery operator.

92
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:39,005
We'll click Install and we'll have
it available on all the namespaces,

93
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,760
will install it to a namespace I
created called OpenShift, NFT.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,940
And this says it could take
a few minutes to create,

95
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,435
but really it just takes
a handful of seconds.

96
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,100
Once it's finished.

97
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,750
Installing the operator will go
into that operator and create

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,600
an instance of it so that we
can configure it for cluster.

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,630
So over here back in the operator console,

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,849
we'll click on this
node feature discovery.

101
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,890
And we'll create that operand
with the defaults in this case.

102
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,550
And we'll go back over
to our node or GPU node.

103
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,440
And we'll notice in the
detail section that

104
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,540
once it's running it, there it goes.

105
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,540
It'll populate labels, extra labels on

106
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,170
this node to identify
features that it's found.

107
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,520
The ones we really care about
for this demo is the in video 1.

108
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
So if we go down here,

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,790
we can see this PCI 10 DE,

110
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,410
that's the identifier for individual
devices it's present equals true,

111
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,050
along with a number of other things that
the GPU operator needs to know about.

112
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,330
So now that that's available to us,

113
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,380
Let's go back to the operator hub
will search for the GPU operator.

114
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,120
There it is, invidious GPU operator.

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,784
We'll click Install.

116
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:59,015
And one of the things we need to do

117
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:01,010
before we install it actually is to create

118
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,530
a namespace for that operator to live in.

119
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,830
So I'm going to go ahead and just paste

120
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,030
simple little command line command

121
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,910
that will create a namespace
with the name we need,

122
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,780
which is NVIDIA GPU dash operator.

123
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,530
Okay?

124
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,330
And once that is available,

125
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,860
we will say install it
into that namespace.

126
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,400
We'll choose the update channel
we want and click Install.

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,500
So once this finishes installing,

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,255
we can click View operator.

129
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,685
That'll take us over to this
installed operators page.

130
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,295
We'll click on cluster
policy and create a new one.

131
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:42,215
This cluster policy lets us can figure
how this GPU operator is going to work.

132
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:44,540
We'll take the defaults and click Create.

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,790
Notice that we, it creates

134
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,965
this GPU cluster policy and we're in
the NVIDIA GPU operator namespace.

135
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:55,880
So go ahead and let this do its
activities in the background.

136
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,735
And when we come back,
we'll do a demo back.

137
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,375
And now we've got this
cluster policy installed.

138
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,030
The nodes all set up and configured
with all the drivers and

139
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,240
everything that the operator did for us.

140
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,585
So we can verify that by
being we can do OC get pods.

141
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,525
And we can see in our namespace
we've got all these running pods.

142
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:20,930
We can use OCI get Daemon set also to see

143
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,880
that all the daemon sets are
currently ready that we need, right?

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,210
So another cool thing we
can do is while we're here,

145
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,760
we can see details of
that GPU device, right?

146
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,860
So we can do an OC exact dash IT.

147
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,820
We can grab this pod here.

148
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,440
We can paste that in.

149
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,790
And we can do Nvidia dash R sub y.

150
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,860
And that's going to tell us that we've got

151
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,390
this Tesla T4 and the details around that.

152
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,150
So going back over here,

153
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,345
now, we can flip to the Developer View.

154
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:05,390
We can hop over into a GPU
demo project and we can create

155
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:14,525
a YAML configuration that's going to
say run this Invidia vector AD sample.

156
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,090
But first, before we do that,

157
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,730
let's just cut out the resources and we'll

158
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,610
see without the GPU will create that,

159
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,755
we're going to expect that to fail.

160
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:27,995
All right, so that's going to be failed.

161
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,810
Failed to allocate.

162
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,645
Could a driver, right?

163
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,000
So if we go back to the pods,

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,640
we can delete that pod.

165
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,210
We can go to add from YAML.

166
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,075
We'll grab this thing again.

167
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:45,755
We'll paste it in.

168
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,040
And now this time we'll do one GPU, right?

169
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,525
And it'll create that. And
now if we go to our logs,

170
00:09:53,525 --> 00:10:00,210
will see vector add cuda, kernel and past.

171
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,145
So I cleaned up the previous
demo and I've deployed

172
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,110
another demo in a different namespace.

173
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,130
And then similarly, I've requested

174
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,995
access to that GPU node the
same way we did before.

175
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:15,894
But this time I've exposed a
round and created a service.

176
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,875
So I can click the link to that route,

177
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,630
which will open the web browser up.

178
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,860
And now I have access to a
series of Jupiter Notebooks.

179
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,990
So this is an Nvidia example container
that provides various data science,

180
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,545
artificial intelligence, machine
learning type activities.

181
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,870
And so let's just choose one.

182
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,450
Like we'll go into this
signal processing notebook.

183
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,400
In the new book describes itself.

184
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,280
It talks about how it's comparing

185
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,605
different operations of FFTs running
on the CPU and running on a GPU.

186
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:53,075
So if I click through and
execute a few of these,

187
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:55,220
they'll finish the time themselves.

188
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,800
They'll show us the difference
between how long it took to

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,130
execute these operations
on the GPU and the CPU.

190
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,780
But another interesting thing,

191
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,950
the reason wanted to show you this is if
I flip back over to the command line,

192
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,230
I can get that pod.

193
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,015
Let's get the name of that pod.

194
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,440
And let's go ahead and execute

195
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,960
that same nvidia SMI command that
we did earlier in this video.

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,150
And we'll take a look and
see what's different.

197
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,725
Notice that in this bottom section
now there's three processes listed.

198
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,600
Type C, which means compute,

199
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,470
and it also shows us how much memory
of the GPU Each of them is using.

200
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,315
We only scratch the surface
today and there's definitely

201
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:37,490
much more information you can get

202
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,890
off of red hats websites
and videos websites.

203
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,020
So I encourage you to take
a look at these links

204
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,550
and continue learning more
about using GPUs and OpenShift.
